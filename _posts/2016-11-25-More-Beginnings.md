First night in Van Halen down! I was a little bit under the weather
and hadn't been sleeping well in general, but sleeping in a van didn't
seem to make anything worse. I was just in underwear beneath a very
nice double fleece blanket courtesy of Anna and was generally
comfortable but with cold feet. Given the season and where I'm heading
I suspect I will spend most nights in a sleeping bag.

First breakfast was what-will-become-the-standard yogurt and
granola. Pretty tasty. I then cleaned out the mat in my living room
because I had split beer on it the night before. I'm still getting
used to moving around in the confined space. Fortunately almost none
got on the carpet and it was with practiced ease that I was able to
rid the van of stank beer smell.

The next order of business was to construct some blinds to keep out
the light at night. Last night I had jury rigged some blinds with
Velcro, but it was painfully obvious that this was not a permanent
solution. Fortunately I was parked right next to a Home Depot and was
able to easily get the materiel I needed to whip up some bomb-ass
curtain rods. I'll post a description of the build soon. The blinds
themselves came from Walmart and are called something like "Eclipse
**ULTRA** *LIGHTFUCKER*" blackout blinds, or something, so they should
keep it nice and dark inside.

The weather was extremely excellent and matched crew morale as I drove
to DIA to store Van Halen temporarily as I flew to California to help
Mary move to Denver. We did the drive in 2 days (which felt like
nothing after the drive from Madison) and arrived safely in Denver
around 10am on another wonderful day (is the weather always this good
in Denver?). There was a big snow storm that dumped on I-70 over the
mountains the night before we crossed, but it was a cake walk for
us. Now I'm hanging out in Denver for a few days before setting off
again. Just to keep you interested here are some shots from the drive
from LA to Denver (click for larger images and captions). The west is
much more interesting than the center.
