My path to Bryce Canyon took me farther down UT 9, through Zion, and
an early departure from Springdale assured I only had a minimal wait
at the Zion entrance station. After traversing the surprisingly
narrow and dark Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel I was soon out of the park and
in the surrounding pastures. That's the thing about canyons; you can't
really tell they're there until you're right on top (or inside) of
them. In Mt. Carmel I hit north on US 89 for a few decades (of miles)
before turning east on to UT 12, which apparently is some sort of
super special highway or something. Not long after that it was south
on UT 63 to the entrance of Bryce Canyon NP. After getting some beta
at the visitor center I decided to start my visit by driving to the
southern end of the park to check out Rainbow Point. This point (and
Bryce in general) is surprisingly high (Rainbow pt. is at 9,115 feet)
and as a result it was pretty darn cold and the ground was still
covered with snow. From Rainbow Pt. you could see most of Bryce
"Canyon" (more of an eroded plateau, but w/e) and for what seemed like
ever out to the southeast across the Colorado Plateau. In fact, Bryce
is basically the top of this plateau and the so-called Grand Staircase
leads from its high cliffs down across multiple "steps" (layers in the
earth) to the rim of the Grand Canyon 4,000 feet below. I had lunch
and enjoyed this commanding vista of one of my favorite parts of this
country.

On the way back to the main section of Bryce (the Bryce Amphitheater)
I stopped at a few view points. All of them offered new views onto a
scenery of pink hoodoos basking in the Sun. At one there was a pretty
big arch that was cool. Check it out.

Soon I was at Sunset Point, which offered a gorgeous view of the
Bryce Amphitheater and was appropriately overflowing with the
squawking masses. The basic geologic story of Bryce is that
relatively soft limestone protruding from the edge of its escarpment is
easily eroded by water and ice into the fantastical spires (hoodoos)
that visitors enjoy today.

At the recommendation of, well, _everyone_ I decided to do Bryce's #1
hike: down into the Queen's Garden with a return up the Navajo
Loop. This hike finally brought me down between the hoodoos and the
deeper I got the more amazing the formations seemed. There was even
one that seemed to be punching the sun in defiance of the weather
cycle that would eventually lead to its destruction.

Perhaps uniquely among famous geologic sites, the size of the
formations in Bryce make them very accessible. Unlike the great
canyons elsewhere in Utah the scale of Bryce is roughly human; a hike
among the hoodoos feels intimate and the closeness of the formations
means each turn in the trail results in a new and interesting view.

At the bottom of the trail was the Queen's Garden, so named because of
a stately hoodoo that bears an uncanny resemblance to Her Majesty the
Queen. What oh!

From up on the canyon rim Bryce might appear to be a one trick pony,
but from below you discover that there is a seemingly endless
variation in that one trick. It's a very good trick. The hoodoos
themselves stand in strange arrangements of pink, white, and
orange, and perhaps even stranger is the contrast provided by the
trees that grow seemingly impossibly between them. This is a very
unique place; truly unlike anywhere I have ever been. Driving this
fact home are the vivid memories I have of being here when I was 8
years old. While walking between the spires I could remember standing
in that _exact_ spot 20 years ago. I don't have similar memories of,
e.g., Zion, even though I visit it at the same time. Such is the power
of Bryce's unique scenery.

After the hike I found a campsite on some free land just outside the
park (I could literally see the boundary fence from my camp), cooked a
very spicy pot of beans, and lit a fire. I had forgotten, and hope not
to forget again, how wonderful a fire can be. It is the perfect object
for meditation in the wilderness and I suspect that many of humanity's
best ideas came through the hypnotic dance of fire's flames.

It was cold up at 8,000 feet and when I awoke the thermometer read 22
F inside. Brrr. I was up quick, enjoyed a free breakfast at the local
Best Western, and was soon back below the rim, this time on the
Fairyland Loop trail.

This trail made its way down, around, and through a smaller and
younger version of the Bryce Amphitheater. It's a little more off the
beaten path and this, combined with my early start, meant that I
hardly saw anyone as I headed into the canyon.

Fairyland, being a younger, less-developed canyon, had fewer amazing
features of the kind found in the main amphitheater. Instead the draw
of the trail was a very pleasant walk down ridges, around points, and
through sparse pine forests. Of course, there were plenty of
interesting features as well. My favorites were the Tower Bridge and something I thought might be the castle of Fairyland.

This might sound crazy, but this trail (and the trails of yesterday,
now that I think about it) were very "friendly". I'm not sure exactly
how to explain what that means other than I felt like every aspect of
the scenery was open and welcoming. Bryce might be a small park that
can be enjoyed quickly, but that doesn't mean the enjoyment or
appreciation is any less special than the other parks that dot this
country. They are all testaments to the power of a place to lift up
our spirits and leave us with a renewed connection to the wild of our
heritage.

# Errata

* It seemed like 90% of the visitors to Bryce were foreign. Mostly
  French, German, and Russian if I had to guess from the languages I
  heard. Bryce is a great park, but it seems like a strange place for
  such a high concentration of Europeans.
