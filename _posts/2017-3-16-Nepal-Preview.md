As astute readers of this log may have noticed I sort of disappeared
for all of February and most of March. The reason is simple: I was in
Nepal (also Qatar for a while) trekking around and seeing some awesome
sights and scenes. My plan is to condense over a month of travels into
a few posts for public consumption. This currently feels like a
daunting task so here's a preview of what will follow that is designed
to whet your appetite and force me to actually follow up on my
promise.

The short story is that while in Nepal I: hiked a bunch, climbed a lot
of stairs, saw some amazing mountains, soaked in some awesome hot
springs, went on safari, saw elephants and rhinos, got some culture,
and chilled with some monkeys. Here's proof:
