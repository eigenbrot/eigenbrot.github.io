The drive from Colorado Springs to Pagosa Springs took about 4.5
hours, and was some of the best driving I've had yet. It started with
a trip down the increasingly wild front range on I-25 and then
followed US 160 west over La Veta pass and into the amazing San Luis
valley. The scenery was increasingly excellent. In particular Blanca
Peak was breathtaking in its imposing stance at the southeastern end
of the valley. My friends in Colorado Springs spoke highly of the
wilderness opportunities throughout the San Luis and I am excited to
give this wonderful area a closer look in the future.

Between Pueblo and Ft. Garland it was very windy. Like, *very*
windy. I was actually blown into the adjacent lane on a few occasions
and I was glad there wasn't much traffic. Once I got on US 160 I was
headed straight into the wind, which made for easier driving, but
can't have been good for mileage. All the road signs along this stretch
had been rotated parallel to the road by the wind, so it must be windy
all the time here.

I stayed on US 160 as it raced across the valley floor and through
Alamosa, which apparently is the coldest city in the lower
48. Whoa. Just outside Alamosa I picked up a great radio show called
[Woodsongs](http://www.woodsongs.com/), a live, roots music variety
show with some very cool music and good interviews. It was a great
driving companion and I was sad when the mountains cut off the signal.

The mountains in question were the eastern edge of the San Juan
range. I followed US 160 up over Wolf Creek pass and down to Pagosa
Springs. The top of the pass was a bit shy of 11,000 feet and I
suspect that it was the last time I'll be anywhere near that altitude
for the rest of the trip. The western side of the pass was steep and
beautiful and it took real effort to keep my mind focused on staying
on the road instead of marveling at the view.

Before I knew it I was in Pagosa Springs. The first task was to drive
around like a creeper to find a good place to sleep for the
night. With that accomplished I headed over to the library to get a
little work done. On the way back was greeted with a stunning view as
the setting sun set off a ring of alpenglow in the surrounding
mountains.

The town itself is nestled in a little valley and mainly spread out
along the San Juan river. Directly down town are the hot springs that
the town is know for. There are a few businesses set up to take
advantage of this natural bounty, ranging from small buildings filled
with pools to large, resort-style hotels. My plan was to patronize one
of the former, but before that I needed some dinner. I parked in a
park along the river and had a very good time heating up food and
jammin' to some tunes. Dinner is better when you can stay outside.

After dinner I went to the local brewpub, Riff Raff Brewery. It was
packed, but I was able to find a tiny seat at the end of the bar
pretty quickly. Some live music was just starting and the chairs next
to me were constantly refilled by friendly people who made the whole
night very enjoyable. The beer was good but not amazing, just what a
small spot in a small town needs. One thing worth mentioning was their
Tonic IPA. I didn't see it offered as a pint, but I got a Gin and
Tonic made with the usual spirit and a dash of this Tonic IPA. I'm not
sure it was a drink that needed to exist, but it was weird enough that
I'm glad it did.

Suitably sudded I ambled down the street to the Overlook
Hot springs. From the outside it looks like any other store on the main
strip, but inside is filled with pools of different temperatures, all
heated by the hot springs. On the roof were two of the hottest (and
therefore best) pools and I spent a long time up there gazing out
across the town and up into the clear, dark sky.

If Dan Carlin were to read my account as if it were an ancient text it
 might sound something like this:

*Around my feet the last thrust of geologic energy from deep within
the Earth boiled forth and condensed to steam as it reached for the
heavens. Above me the moon, made luminous by its slavish devotion to
the Sun, pierced through the night sky to impose its will upon the
land. Closer to the horizon the great hunter Orion aimed an arrow
straight at this transient interloper in an attempt to recapture his
celestial dominance. Beneath this heavenly drama the town of Pagosa
Springs slept, dreamily enveloped in a wreath of steam derived from
energy primordial.*

Needless to say I left the Overlook feeling slightly more connected to
something or other. On the way out the proprietress said I had "good
energy" and gave me a pass for a free future soak. I don't know when
I'll be back, but it will certainly be too long.

Body still radiating residual geothermal energy I headed back to Van
Halen and slept very well. When I woke up Surprise! Snow! It seems we
had got about 1 inch over the night. I took advantage of the peaceful
morning to walk along the river and see a quieter side of the
town. Past the main drag some of the hot water formed a sort of marsh
and with the steaming water and tall plants I half expect the Lady of
the Lake to emerge and grant me the means to take back my
kingdom. Sadly, no Excalibur emerged, but the scenery more than made
up for it.

After a few hours in a local caffeinery most of the snow had melted and
I was ready to hit the road for Durango, a mere hour to the west.

A few more small things:

* There were two conversation topics at Riff Raff Brewery. The first
  was skiing, which makes sense because there are a lot of ski areas
  around. The second was oil drilling/prospecting/working,
  etc. etc. etc. Weird.

* For breakfast I parked in a public lot while there was still a lot
  of fresh snow on the ground. Once the snow melted I was extremely
  pleased to see that I had somehow made it right between the
  lines. #nailedit.
  

* I had heeded signs at the Overlook to remove silver jewelry (the
  sulfur will tarnish silver), but just walking by the river the next
  morning and exposed me to enough fumes that my ring took on a rather
  cool black shine. It's already rubbing off, but I like how it looks.
