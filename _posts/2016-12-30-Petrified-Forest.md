title: Petrified Forest National Park
excerpt: Where the mud is sticky, the trees are stone and they've got a big collection of dinosaur bones!

After leaving Flagstaff it was a short and pleasant drive to the
Petrified Forest National Park. The nearby town of Holbrook tried to
pull the same sign shenanigans as [Williams]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/posts/2016-12-23-Grand-Canyon) and I almost ended up
going to the wrong park entrance! Fortunately my bullshit detector
had been recently calibrated and I managed to get to the right place.

Petrified Forest doesn't have any trails or campgrounds and instead
just lets you hike and camp pretty much wherever you damn well
please. My super-sneaky plan was to get a (free) permit for overnight
camping and then just sleep in the parking lot. Everything was going
well, but as I read the permit I saw that I was required to be at
least a mile from my car from 5pm until sunrise. They were on to me!

Thus discovered I decided to make the most of the situation and geared
up for a nice trek out into the Painted Desert section of the park. By
3pm I had left Van Halen in the company of a very respectable looking
tree and was on my way out into the desert. Before long the trail
disappeared completely and I was free to roam around. Weirdly, the
entirety of the ground in every direction was extremely muddy. Imagine
a landscape with many different types of ground: meadows, dirt,
riverbeds, hills, etc. etc. Now imagine that, no matter what the
ground *looks* like, stepping on it will result in another pound of
mud caked to your boots. This was my reality. I actually didn't mind,
though, and it was kind of fun squelching around the place.

Despite the scoffing of the visitor center attendant I was able to
find the famous Onyx Bridge without too much difficulty and was
equally pleased to find a dry spot of gravel nearby for my tent. I set
up camp and continued my exploration unburdened. I'm sure this will
come as no surprise, but the area had an ample supply of petrified
wood and dirt/mud of a wide range of colors. By itself, and when you
really think about it, the petrified wood is really cool. These are
trees that are over *250 million* years old. Wow! The fossils are
extremely wood-like in appearance but are all hard silica rocks with
fantastic colors. That said, this stuff is *everywhere* and is strewn
about it a very disorganized and chaotic way. So, despite the coolness
of it, I quickly got over the petrified wood.

I also realized that the Painted Desert was the same [purgatory]({{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2016-12-17-HeavenHell) from
outside Tuba City. Walking around it I had the same impressions; it
certainly wasn't ugly (I especially like the weird, brainy patterns
formed by water channels in the cracked mud), but it really wasn't very
pretty or inspiring either. If mother nature is a poet then the Grand
Canyon is a masterwork written at the height of her career when she
was still relatively young and ambitious; [Valley of the Gods]({{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2016-12-16-VotG) is a piece
written after she is older, more contemplative, and more subtle; and
the Painted Desert is from her high school years. A talented
high-schooler, perhaps, but lacking confidence and experience.

After a dinner I spent a long time looking up at the spectacularly
dark sky. Around 9pm the wind shifted and suddenly I could hear trucks
chugging along way out on I-40. Talk about isolation! The night was
very cold in the tent (hopefully my last cold night!) and I can't say
I slept well. With dawn came a hike back to Van Halen (this time over
hard, frozen ground). After breakfast I finished the rest of the park
road while stopping to see the highlights along the way. After my hike
yesterday all of the highlights were simply more of the same, although
Blue Mesa was actually pretty cool and worth the stop. The Rainbow
Forest visitor center at the southern entrance had some very cool
dinosaur skeletons, but by this point I was tired of seeing petrified
wood. All in all, I'd say Petrified Forest National Park is a great
way to spend about 4 hours or so, but is somewhat of a one-trick pony.

On advice from my elders the destination for the night was Safford,
AZ, which I reached via US 180, AZ 180A, AZ 61, US 60, and US 70. This
was a pleasantly pastoral drive and ran through a wide range of
scenery, ranging from NorCal-esque ranch land to the completely
stunning and unexpected Salt River Canyon. I hope people raft down
that river. Once in Safford I got some good beta from the BLM on
nearby free camping and some hot springs (!). I spent the night just
outside of town on BLM land and was overjoyed to record a low of 42
degrees. I had finally made it somewhere warm!
