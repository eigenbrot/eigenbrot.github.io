A trip to Death Valley has been one of my major to-do's for over a
decade so I was very excited when I woke up in Bishop with the
intention of finally crossing it off the list. As I headed south, the
familiar drive down US 395 became unfamiliar as I turned onto CA 136
east in Lone Pine. Soon after I was on CA 190 climbing into the Argus
range, which is the first of two mountain ranges separating the Owens
and Death valleys. Not long after entering the mountains I had the
living bejeezus scared out of me by a fighter jet buzzing the road in
what I can only assume was a display of admiration for my sweet
ride. With the resulting adrenaline still pumping through my veins I
pulled into a nearby viewpoint to watch a pair of jets make repeated
runs down a narrow canyon right in front of me. Every time they flew
past a few car alarms in the parking lot went off, and at least once
they flew directly overhead no more than 100 feet away. Must be fun!

Once the adrenaline had worn off I got back on the road and was soon
driving down into the Panamint Valley. There is a small "town" here
that seems to be little more than an overpriced gas station
($4.44/gal!) but I was quite surprised at how big the valley itself
is. I had imagined the drive to Death Valley as mostly flat but
instead it involved going up, over, and down two very impressive
mountain ranges. The second of these ranges is the Panamint range and
before I knew it I was up at 5,000 feet as I crossed them at Towne
Pass. After that it was over 5,000 feet down to Stovepipe wells where
I found a visitor center and gas for sane people.

I got some decent beta from the ranger (including a few spots to camp
for free) and it wasn't too long before I was just down the road at
the Mesquite Flat dune field. For most of my journey I have
experienced weather on the colder side of pleasant and was thus quite
unprepared for the searing noon time heat of Death Valley. Van Halen's
thermometer registered about 98 F, but what really got me was how
_dry_ it was down there. After sliding around the dunes a bit I sought
some shelter from the sun beneath a low shrub but the dryness was more
than I could bear and by the time I returned to Van Halen I felt an
almost primal urge to get somewhere I could cool down. That place
ended up being the Furnace Creek visitor center, where I learned a
bunch of cool shit and drank a bunch of cool water. Soon I felt my old
self again.

No trip to Death Valley would be complete without a visit to Badwater,
which, at -282 feet, is the lowest piece of dry land in the United
States. There was a sign advertising this fact and we were also
afforded the opportunity to walk out on salt flats towards the other
side of the valley (McTeague style). Standing out on this frying pan
salt plane I though about the Low2High route (another life goal of
mine) - all of the (big) mountains between where I stood and
Mt. Whitney; the desolation of the land between them; and the
strength-draining heat present at lower elevations - suddenly it
seemed like a very hard hike. On my way back to the car I made sure to
lean down and get a breath from the bottom of the Badwater sign; the
gluttony of oxygen was almost too much to handle.

Exposure to midday heat had once again heated me up and rather than
return to the Furnace Creek visitor center I headed over to the
Furnace Creek Inn. After some snooping around I discovered an unlocked
and unguarded (but still occupied) pool surrounded by palm trees in
the heart of Death Valley! I almost couldn't get in fast enough and I
spent over an hour immersed in the cooling waters of this testament to
man's desire to laugh in the face of nature's harshest aggressions.

After my swim it was time to make camp so I took the ranger's
suggestion and found a dirt road just off the road to Dante's View. A
mile down was a nice little spot to park and I ate dinner and cleaned
my living room a bit while blasting some tunes into the desert air. Up
where I was, at 3,000 ft, the air was a completely pleasant 75 F and
that night it stayed around 60. My first day in Death Valley was a
good one; I saw a lot of cool stuff and learned what real heat can do.

The next morning I was up before dawn so that I could get to Dante's
view in time for sunrise. From over 3,000 feet directly above Badwater
this ridge provides commanding views of the valley and the Panamint
range. Apart from some snow on Telescope peak the landscape was
nothing but rock and sand and salt as far as the eye could see. Some
clouds provided a little more drama and they continued to build up as
the morning progressed.

Traveling down from Dante's View the temperature steadily increased as
I put more and more air above me. Before the day got totally
unbearable I stopped at the abandon Harmony Borax mine. Back in the
day Borax was the only way to pry a profit from this barren landscape
and Harmony was the first of many Borax mines in the valley. Despite
the heat they actually had to refine the Borax right here at the
source because it was so goddamn awful to transport stuff out of the
valley. I believe it!

The next stop was Salt Creek, which actually had quite a bit of water
in it. In addition to water the creek is home to the Salt Creek
Pupfish, a fish that, through isolation in the aforementioned creek,
evolved into a completely unique species. There were a lot of them
playing in the water but apparently in the summer most of them die when
the creek dries up. Life sucks like that sometimes.

 <figcaption>Marble in Mosaic Canyon</figcaption>

At this point the sky was completely covered with clouds so for my
last stop in Death Valley I decided to go on a hike up Mosaic
Canyon. Right away the canyon was very interesting; its walls were
made of slick marble(!) and they formed something kind of like a slot
canyon. Soon, however, it opened up and became just sort of a smallish
canyon with a gravel bottom and not really that inspiring. I turned
around before I reached the end because the Sun was starting to break
through the clouds and I needed to make tracks to Mojave to meet my
brother.

Once outside the park, on the other side of the Panamint range, I
turned south into the Panamint Valley on the appropriately named
Panamint Valley Road, which eventually became the Trona Wildrose Rd,
then the Trona Rd, and finally CA 178 into Ridgecrest. The drive down
the length of the Panamint Valley was awesome in the literal sense of
the word. The valley is dominated by the flanking ranges of the Argus
and Panamint while the floor was covered in a soft shade of green from
fields of sagebrush. This empty valley was also the last known
whereabouts of the Manson family. Would I make that grim connection?

After rejoining US 395 for a few miles before turning onto Garlock Rd
to CA 14 I ended up in Mojave where there was just enough time for one
more small adventure. While I was getting ice at a gas station I was
approached by a man who needed money to catch a bus to California
City, just a few miles up the road. I didn't have any cash, but I
offered him a ride. His name was too complicated to remember but he
said he had just got out of jail and was heading back to work in Ca
City. He had a lot of good things to say about the city itself and
they contrasted starkly with the state of affairs when we finally
arrived. If someone ever tells you to go to California City they are
probably trying to trick you. Still, it was home for my passenger so I
let him off with a smile and a handshake and headed back down the road
to Mojave.

* Driving south of the Panamint Valley you eventually pass through the
  town of Trona, CA. Trona sucks. No matter where you live or how much
  you hate it, at least you don't live in Trona.
