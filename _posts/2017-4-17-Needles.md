I spent the day after [Bears Ears]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-04-15-Bridge-Ears) driving north on US 191 towards
Canyonlands. I stopped in Monticello to work at the library and
resupply. As the afternoon got late I resumed the northward journey on
US 191 until turning east onto UT 211 towards the Needles district of
Canyonlands. About 30 miles later I was surrounded by nothing but
rugged red cliffs and scrub-covered desert. Rather than enter the park
right away I made an early camp on some BLM land (now technically part
of [Bears Ears]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-04-15-Bridge-Ears#bears-ears)) just past the Hamburger
Rock campground. That night I made one of the best s'mores I've ever
had.

The next morning I was at the visitor center right when they opened
and was looking for some trail beta. The ranger suggested either the Chesler
Park/Joint loop or the Druid Arch trail, and, as the former sounded
more "Needly", I soon found myself getting ready at the trailhead and
setting off towards Chesler Park.  The trail was almost entirely over
the red rock of that forms Cedar Mesa but was well marked by perfectly
placed (for now) cairns. Unlike most other trails I had hiked recently
the Chesler Park trail was also nice and flat, apart from a small
climb up to a gap in a wall of rock that leads to Chesler Park itself.

Chesler Park is a wide field of low creosote and scattered grasses
surrounded by the tall rock formations that give the Needles its name
(although really they're more like spires, whatever). The "park" was
quite green and the whole scene felt a bit like tumbling into some
secret desert garden.

The trail wound its merry way along the edge of the park before
finding another gap in the wall and joining a jeep trail for about 1/2
a mile or so. At the end of this, under the merciful shade of a
welcoming pine I had lunch and set out for a return along the Joint
Trail.

Almost immediately this trail was very different. I ducked and dived
through a series of large, long caves, each with many side canyons
that demanded further exploration and I spent a long time doing
exactly that.

the Joint" %}

In one of these side caves I had my first run-in with someone who
would factor heavily in the narrative just a little while later. At
the time he was little more than a shadow in a cave.

In a large cave covered in cairns the trail seemed to disappear into a
jumble of rocks and while deciding what to do I met the shadowy figure
from before. Ed is a transplant from Australia who now lives in San
Francisco and together we decided to follow some narrow cracks down
into the jumble of rocks where we were able to squeeze out into the
bottom of a narrow canyon.

Soon the canyon opened out of the wall of rocks we had been traversing
in the caves and we followed a very faint trail out into the plains
beyond. About 10 minutes later (when we were lost and about to become
Very Lost) Ed echoed my own thoughts when he suggested turning
back. Even with our own boot-prints to guide the way this was slightly
challenging and I shudder to think how long it would have taken to
find our bones if we hadn't turned around when we did; the rock wall
with the caves effectively blocked access to the main part of the park
so "going around" wasn't really an option.

Soon, however, we had scrambled back up the jumble of rocks and found
the cairn where it all went wrong. With so many cairns in the big cave
it wasn't immediately obvious which were for navigation and which had
been erected by well meaning rock art enthusiasts.

Soon we had found the correct path and had exited the cave system
through a narrow crack in the rock.

Throughout the whole experience Ed had been a wonderful hiking
companion and when we came to a fork in the trail I decided to stay
with him on a hike to Druid Arch rather than hike back to Van Halen
alone. He works in aerospace and has a brain that seems to vibrate on
a similar frequency as yours truly. As we hiked up Elephant Canyon
towards Druid Arch the miles fell away under the sound of our boots
and our conversations.

The trail here was very different than either Chesler Park or the
Joint and as we hiked up the bottom of the canyon the walls continued
to close in around us. Eventually we reached the end of the canyon and
found Druid Arch, a truly imposing formation that rises 600 feet above
the surrounding rock and cuts a uniquely angular form that is very
reminiscent of Stonehenge.

Perhaps even more breathtaking was the view back down Elephant
Canyon. From up above, the actual canyon floor, with all of its trees
and life, is completely hidden by a shelf of rock so that all you can
see are the bizarre shapes of the needles that flank the canyon. As
the sun got lower and the light got richer and took many, many
pictures.

The hike back to the trailhead was 5.5 miles that I had not planned
for and by the end my legs were starting to feel the distance. Still,
Ed provided ever-excellent distractions as we discussed everything
from human capital to LSD. It was just past 6pm when we reached the
cars and I had hiked over 15 of the finest miles one could hope to
find anywhere. Ed generously invited me to hang out at his campsite
for the night (in the park) and the couple next to us generously gave
us a bottle of wine they didn't want. The night was spent eating
s'mores and relaxing after a long day of hiking.

In retrospect the day in the Needles was probably the climax of my
entire trip. While the days that followed were still full of whimsy
and wilderness, reality would begin to claw its way into my world
almost as soon as I woke up the next morning (as, in fact, it was
secretly doing that night). Since entering Utah I had been
increasingly drawn into a rugged and surreal mindset that mirrored the
land around me, and here in the Needles I had spent the day scrambling
around some of the most wonderfully bizarre landscape I have ever seen
with someone who understood why it was all so important. It was a very
good day.

# Errata

* Ed has a website. [Check it out](http://www.edward-terry.com/)

* I don't want to keep anyone guessing too long so I'll just go ahead
  and say that the clawing reality mentioned above manifested itself
  as a coolant leak in Van Halen. Nothing too serious, but just
  important enough to bring me back down to Earth.
