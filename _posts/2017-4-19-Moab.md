After leaving the [Needles]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-04-17-Needles) it was a relatively quite drive up US 191
to the town of Moab. I used this outdoor Mecca as a base while
exploring the nearby Island in the Sky and Arches National
Parks. During that time I spent enough time just hanging around town
that I figured it deserved a post of its own. So here it is, a post
about Moab...

Moab is the biggest town near, and therefore the jumping off point to,
the truly dizzying amount of recreational opportunities in southeast
Utah. It is therefore very busy and more than a little touristy. That
said, I found many nice, quite spots away from the crowds where I
could relax in unmolested comfort. I'll give a huge shoutout to the
Moab Library that was open for reasonable hours and was very
accommodating to the weary traveler. The streets around the library
were lined with dirtbag vans (including Van Halen), and the lounge
area was full of their drivers, most of them not too different from
yours truly.

Sleeping in Moab could not have been simpler. Once off the main strip
most of the side streets allowed unrestricted parking and relative
anonymity. My first night there I found a great little cul-de-sac
flanked on three sides by parkland. I was lucky to run into the
home-owner across the street who basically told me that no one in town
cares about inoffensive dirtbaggery and I was welcome to stay there
for a while. Sweet!

A night or two later I checked out the only brewery in town, the
surprisingly named Moab Brewery. The beer here was decent and I got a
great tip from the guy sitting next to me: in Utah all beer out of a
tap has to be 4% ABV or lower, so the pros order beer by the can. Soon
I was a pro and making fast friends with the source of this
information. He was extremely nice and bought me a few beers before
inviting me to come visit him in Colorado some time. He was under the
impression that Colorado beer was the best in the country and I
promised to visit him with a car full of Wisconsin's finest in an
effort to prove him wrong.

Whenever I'm in a new town for a while I like to ask locals where the
good eats are. Every single person I asked told me to go to a
quesadilla food cart parked on the main drag so one day I did just
that. The place certainly was hip enough, and, after waiting in line
for 30 minutes, I finally had the coveted quesadilla. Unfortunately the
food itself was very "meh". This quesadilla was clean and neat in all
of the wrong ways and in the end I wished I had just made another
PB&J.

As you might guess, Moab is home to a stupendous number of outdoor
stores, but in my opinion none of them can compete with GearHeads. For
some reason, this store, with its free, filtered water is seared into
my memory banks from my first trip through Moab, when we stopped here
to supply ourselves for a trip down the San Juan River. As I've
mentioned before, this river trip was my first exposure to the wonders
of southern Utah and so for whatever reason I had strong memories of
GearHeads as well. Needless to say it's a great store, with a
bafflingly large selection and an entire wall of weird Cliff Bar
flavors for only $1 each.

During my last day in the area I took a drive down the Colorado River
(which runs through Moab) along UT 279. This road snakes along the
river as it runs between tall red cliffs on its way to its meeting
with the Green River in Canyonlands NP.

It also seemed to be a popular spot for climbers. Most of the routes
started right on the side of the road and left only a few feet of
asphalt between your belayer and oncoming traffic!

The pavement ends not far from a potash mine, but a gravel road does
continue up the canyon wall and eventually sneaks into Island in the
Sky via the White Rim Road. Given a 4-wheel drive vehicle I'm sure it
would be a very fun drive.

So there you go. Moab: a cool place to visit. Here's a city on-par
with [Bishop]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-03-19-Cascade-Sierra#bishop) in terms of
dirtbag-ability. The streets were packed with vans for a reason.
