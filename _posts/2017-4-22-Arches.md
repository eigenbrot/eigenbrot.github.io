Arches NP was my last stop in Red Rock country and I explored it over
two days while keeping Moab as a home base. The entrance to the park
is about 2 miles outside of town, so it is understandably popular and
crowded. On my first day I beat the crowds by getting to the park
right when they opened and immediately driving all the way to the end
of the road for a hike in the Devil's Garden area. Unfortunately,
after the long process of suiting up, putting on sunscreen, and
assembling supplies for a long hike, I looked under Van Halen and was
shocked to find the front section soaked with coolant. After some
mental debate I decided it was a good day to spend in Moab trying to
fix this thing, which meant much less hiking! Not one to entirely
waste an opportunity to hike I decided to do a short out-and-back to
Landscape Arch with a tiny side trip to Pine Tree and Tunnel Arches.

Landscape Arch was huuge - about 300 feet wide or something - a looked
extremely fragile. Signs around the arch mentioned that people are no
longer allowed to walk beneath it because a large section collapsed
off of it back in the 90's and the rest might go at any time. Looking
at its impossibly delicate form I could certainly envision the
imminent collapse, and I fantasized about being one of the lucky few
to be there to see the event. Sadly this did not happen.

In contrast, Pine Tree Arch was very thick and robust - a proper
arch!. I'm not sure why it's called pine tree, but whatever.

Tunnel Arch was perhaps my favorite of the three. Its placement high
up in the face of a rock fin made it easy to spot, easy to look at,
and easy to enjoy.

On the way back into Moab I couldn't help but stop at the visitor
center to check out the park video (a favorite activity of mine), and
boy was I glad I did! Of all the parks I have been to on this trip I
dare say that Arches may have the best visitor center, from an
informational point of view. Despite having been to the Grand Canyon,
Zion, Bryce, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands (all parks with similar
formation histories) I learned a lot of new information about the area
and how the amazing rock features formed. In particular, the role of
huge, underground plugs of salt was fascinating. Nice work!

A few days later, after failing to even diagnose Van Halen's coolant
leak, I was back in Arches, this time even earlier in an attempt to be
the first person to the super-popular Delicate Arch so I could grab
some people-free dawn shots. I was not the first car in the Delicate
Arch lot, but the 1.5 mile trail to the arch gave me an opportunity to
pull out in front. At one point I lost the trail for a moment, but a
helpful bunny built a cairn to show me the way.

When I arrived at Delicate Arch I was disappointed to find that the
Sun was rising behind the arch, thus rendering any dawn pictures
totally unachievable. That didn't stop me and about 100 other
photographers from trying, though! Once I got over this minor
inconvenience, however, I came to appreciate the strange beauty of not
just the arch, but also the environment in which it stands. The arch
sits on the edge of a large rock bowl and, unlike the other arches I
had seen, stands completely alone. It's easy to see why this is such a
popular arch.

After spending the morning hanging out near Delicate Arch I hiked back
and drove to the Delicate Arch viewpoint, which is pretty far from the
arch itself, but offers views from the other side. By this time the
sun was high enough up in the sky that the light was bright and
boring, but it was still interesting to see the arch in a broader
context.

After Delicate Arch I was off to the Windows area, which might have
been my favorite area of the park. The entire formation (massif? I
think it's called the Garden of Eden) is absolutely stunning; here is
a collection of rock gardens, many with arches, rising out of the
surrounding hillside while the ever-present La Sal mountains watch in
snowy silence far in the background.

Double Arch was really sweet - it's rock formation held a very chaotic
assortment of arches and pre-arches and it all felt very raw and wild.
The Double Arch itself was huge and imposing to stand beneath.

Other arches in the Windows area included Turret Arch:

and the Windows, which looked like two giant eyes staring out across the desert.

On my way out of the park I had time to stop briefly at Balanced Rock,
which certainly lives up to its name.

As I left Arches I felt that I had simultaneously seen almost all
there was to see and also not really penetrated beneath the surface.
I'm not sure if this is because I was rushing from site to site or if
Arches is really all about the arches (which are totally awesome) and
not much else. It's probably the former and I look forward to proving
that to myself sometime in the future.
