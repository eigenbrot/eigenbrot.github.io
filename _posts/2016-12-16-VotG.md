# The Valley of the Gods

I left Cortez heading back down US 160 until stabbing north on US 191
to Bluff, UT. There was nothing there, but I would be back later and
wanted to scout it out. My main target the Valley of the Gods, a sort
of Monument Valley Lite that is only accessible via a dirt loop
road. I had chosen it over its more famous cousin because the land is
administered by the BLM, which means a) you can camp anywhere, b) it's
free, and c) it's owned by the American people. In other words, there
would be nothing between me and the essence of this country. I left
Bluff on US 163 south and was soon crossing a moist stream bed into
the Valley of the Gods.

From the highway you can't see much, but as I coaxed Van Halen over
the washboards, dirt, and slickrock the road wound ever deeper into
the valley and each passing foot revealed views more beautiful than
the last. The scenery is like something out of a dream or another
world. To the north the escarpment of Cedar Mesa shoots in vertical
cliffs high above the valley floor while tall rock spires, vanguards
against the never-ending assault of rain and wind, stand in solemn
vigil. All among these spires the ground is covered in sagebrush who's
lush, green colors make a mockery of the idea that a desert is devoid
of life.

I drove a little less than half way into the valley and found a good
place to make camp. From here I could hike to the top of a mini-mesa
where,to my great delight, the view improved beyond what I thought
possible. From up here the entire grandeur of the valley was revealed
and appreciated. Determined to *slow down* I spent a long time on top
of my modest-mesa lying in the sun, taking pictures, and in general
just enjoying how the ever-changing light played of the fissures and
cracks in the surrounding stone.

Out in the middle of what might have been nowhere I realized that the
nowheres are perhaps the most cherished thing this country
has. America was the first, and still one of the few, countries in the
world to set aside land specifically to be left in its natural
state. Ask me what the one, true symbol of America is and I will tell
you it is not a flag or a statue or a person. Many countries have
these things. No, perhaps the greatest resource this country has is
its wild spaces, its nowheres, the idea that just around a few bends
in the road there is a border between the civilized and the
uncivilized, the known and the unknown. Every American understands
this, at least subconsciously. They understand and take comfort in the
fact that, even if they never see it, somewhere out there is untamed
land waiting to be explored. It is in these places that we can store
all of our hopes and dreams, free from the sometimes harsh realities
of modern life; the wild places are the repositories of America's
boundless optimism. They belong to us all and call to us all.

Thoughts of dinner yanked me back from my reverie (but not quite into
reality) and I headed back to camp. I had to cook beans that night and
started them simmering well before the sun went down in the hope that
I could get some good views of the sunset. Unfortunately it had gotten
cloudy on the horizon and there was no sunset to be seen. I made good
use of the time, however, and finally cracked into one of the many
books I had taken with me. Not one to be ignored the Sun managed to
part the clouds just after sunset and the sky erupted as if the fiery
orb had crashed down upon the earth. I sprinted to the top of my
mezze-mesa just in time to take a picture or two (and narrowly avoid a
heart attack!).

That night was the full moon, but once again clouds hindered any real
amazement born from this fact. I spent the night reading in Van Halen
and accidentally completely drained the solar battery, which you are
NOT supposed to do. Oops.

I woke up the next morning just as the Sun was beginning to warm the
eastern horizon and once again sprinted to the top of my micro-mesa to
get a good view. And once again low clouds prevented anything
profound, but I still got a few good pictures.

The morning was spent hiking up a nearby full-on-bluff. There was one
section where the capstone had collapsed and the talus slope led
straight up to a saddle. From here I could see the whole valley and
the next valley over. I stayed here reading for a bit and was quite
comfortable despite the lack of Sun.

I walked back to camp along a dry wash and found some of the usual,
mysteriously old and rusty equipment lying around. Man, people have
been *everywhere*. Once back to camp I continued on the road deeper
into the valley and got very close up to some of the main spires. It
was cool to see them up so close, but I was glad I had chosen a camp
where I could see everything at once.

The western end of Valley of the Gods road ends at UT 261 just before
the Moki Dugway, a portion of the "highway" that climbs directly up
the side of Cedar Mesa. During the last few miles of the VotG road I
was looking for signs of the Moki, but could find none upon the
impossibly sheer cliffs of the Mesa's edge. Imagine my surprise when I
turned onto UT 261 and saw the road disappear into the cliffs directly
in front of me!

  <figcaption>Don't fall off!</figcaption>
</figure>

The road itself is 3 miles from top to bottom, made of well graded
dirt/gravel, has no railings, and is insanely steep. The drop off the
side is totally vertical, and if you lose control the only thing to
stop you would be the valley floor. This was one of the most
awe-inspiring, curse-inducing, and sphincter-clenching stretches of
road I have ever driven.

I did it up and down :)

# Comb Ridge

</figure>

Comb Ridge is another spectacular geological feature along the San
Juan river near Valley of the Gods. This geological upheaval forms a
narrow ridge that runs north to south for many many miles. Its eastern
side slopes gently upwards at about 30 degrees or so until it comes to
an abrupt halt with sheer cliffs facing west. It is a very striking
barrier and was apparently a real problem for early travelers in the
region.

After the Moki Dugway I put some asphalt beneath my wheels again and
headed to Mexican Hat, UT. I stopped at the Old San Juan Bridge Inn
looking for some beta on Comb Ridge petroglyphs the ranger at [Mesa
Verde]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2016-12-14-MesaVerde-Cortez) had told me about. I met a very
nice man named Joey who, while making me a tasty milkshake, told me
all about the area. As a Navajo his connection to this area ran deep
and he had a lot of good information to give. Taking it all in my mind
reeled at the thought of seeing everything even in one lifetime. This
is a region that is begging me to return for years to come.

I left the Inn with simple directions to the Butler Wash (where the
petroglyphs are located): take the road across from the Bluff airport
for 1 mile and turn left at the cattle guard. Easy. It was a fun
little scramble down into the wash, and the petroglyph panel (the
Wolfman panel) was worth the trip. I took the trail a bit farther and
found some old cliff dwellings too. I had also wanted to get to the
western edge of Comb Ridge and spent some time picking my way across
the slickrock as I climbed its eastern slopes. Sadly, in the dwindling
light I was only able to make it to the top of an eastern
sub-ridge. Yet another reason to come back!  {% include gallery

I spent that night at the Sand Island BLM campground just outside
Bluff. During the summer I imagine this is a very lively place (it has
a very nice ranger station and boat launch on the San Juan), but this
late in the season I had it all to myself. I found a site right
against some red cliffs, built a fire, and spent the rest of the night
soaking up its primeval glow, reading, and feeling content. There a
few things better than a night around a fire after a day bounding
about the wilderness.

From the Valley of the Gods to the Moki Dugway to Comb Ridge, this
might have been as close to a perfect day as anyone can hope for. If
you're ever in the area I recommend getting just a little bit lost
among the spires and washes of southern Utah. You might just find
something you didn't know you were missing.

* Oops, I forgot that between Cortez and Bluff I also went to check
  out the Four Corners monument. Here's a picture of it. It was $5 but
  worth the kitsch, I suppose. I made sure to use my phone's GPS to
  stand in the real intersection of the states because the bronze
  medal is actually a little bit off!

  It was crazy to think of old-time surveyors trying to make straight
  lines across hundereds of miles of wilderness and rough
  terrain. Good job, guys!
