What is there to say about my time in San Diego? I hung out with my
friends, enjoyed the wonderful location, ate fish tacos for every
meal, and paid too much for beer that was bitter for no good
reason. These are not novel activities for the denizens of San Diego,
they are the everyday actions of those who have chosen to live a
pleasant and salubrious life in America's Finest City. But OK. For
those of you who don't know, here's what it's like:

Before I even got to San Diego I was already starting to feel the good
vibes. A quick stop in Julian, CA assured that my arrival would
coincide with the consumption of charming crusts containing the
captivating compote of the [Julian Pie
Company](https://julian-pie.myshopify.com/). When I did show up the
weather was perfect and the people were beautiful. I spent a large
part of the morning creeping around the UCSD campus while trying to
surprise a friend of mine, but he was too sneaky and I gave up to go
hang out on the beach. Here I met my
[brother](https://threeveweaver.wordpress.com/) and we crushed a fun
traverse that is literally right on the beach at one end of La Jolla
Cove. I had never climbed in a downtown area before and was both
shocked and inspired by the public's faith in my climbing ability as
they lazily walked and loitered directly below my (sometimes quivering)
legs.

Soon the day was over and the night began, after that there was
another day, and so on. Looking back at my trip to San Diego the days
kind of blend together, so rather than provide a day-by-day I'll tell
you that I... went surfing for the first time! My brother and one of
our friends go surfing with some regularity and our friend had a spare
board and wetsuit so I tagged along and tried it out. After some
on-beach instruction I'm proud to say that I caught the very first
wave I attempted. I'm less proud to say that this was only because my
friend was holding the board steady and gave me a push at the right
time. Still, baby steps. Over the next hour or so I proceeded to fail
on ever other wave I tried, save one where I got up for the better
part of a second before falling over with a huge grin on my face. At
the end of it I couldn't move my arms an inch from all the paddling
and couldn't move my mouth from all the smiling. I need to surf more.

I also spent a lot of time (as you might imagine) hanging out at the
beach. Despite the unusually wintry (for San Diego) weather it was
good to see these boulevards of sand populated every day of the
week. When the Sun went down (too early) the promenades along the
beaches lit up with street lamps and the comfortable murmur of happy
people. Just off Mission Beach one night I found a group of guys in
jacked up hot-rods showing off their hydraulic systems. Right before a
cop showed up one of them was bouncing around like an excited
puppy. It must make his suspension guy very happy.

Another day I met up with another good friend of mine and we checked
out Ocean Beach. The tide was way out and had revealed a wonderful
collection of tide pools beneath the Ocean Beach Pier. Wandering
around, looking for weird creatures, and sticking my fingers in sea
anemones made me feel like a kid again. We also made a new discovery:
the Sea Hare. We first saw one when I nice British man pulled one out
of the water to show off, and afterwards we noticed them
everywhere. They ranged from tiny to huge and we found one that was
about as big as my arm. Crazy!

All too soon it was time to pick up and leave. On my way out of town I
ran into something very unusual for San Diego: a massive rain
storm. The rain itself was no issue, but it finally gave me something
to dislike about the city: no one turns their lights on when its
raining. Apart from that San Diego is as close to perfection as we
might hope to get.

* The Ocean Beach Pier is apparently the longest concrete pier on the West Coast. Cool.

* During some rain on the way to San Diego I noticed some water
  leaking in through Van Halen's font windshield. Further inspection
  showed the sealing around the outside of the windshield had
  disintegrated and come loose. I think the rough roads of [Texas]({{

  Van Halen up.
