  <figcaption>Morning in Sedona</figcaption>
</figure>

I slept in the grocery parking lot with no problems and left early to
avoid any. As the forecast was good I decided to go for a hike and
asked the visitor center for some recommendations. After considering
the options I decided on a loop that went up Munds Wagon road, then
took the Schnebly hill road (dirt) to the top of a ridge before coming
down Casner Canyon and returning along Oak Creek via the Huckaby
Trail. As I set out the weather was exactly what I had hoped
for. Revealed from beneath the veil of yesterday's rain Sedona was
stunningly beautiful. It was almost like a world from a scifi movie,
or Lord of the Rings. The red cliffs and hill were draped in a forest
green and terraced as if by some ancient gardener. Very picturesque.

The hike up the canyon was nice, but coming down the other side was
when things got really good. The trail reminded me of trails in
California (with the addition of cactus) and the weather/Sun was
perfect. It was at the bottom of Casner Canyon that the adventure
began. Evidently the trail was supposed to cross Oak Creek, but the
recent rain had turned this "creek" into a throbbing, muddy torrent
just waiting for someone stupid enough to try to ford it. That person
wasn't me and I searched in vain up and down the bank for some other
way across. Eventually I just started walking in the only direction I
could: upstream away from town. At this point I had left any idea of a
trail far behind and was walking across boulders, over log jams, and
through dense thickets of grabbing brambles. At one point I heard some
machinery and followed the sound to a gardener grooming a very nice
garden just on the other side of the water. The raging river and his
loud machine drowned out my cries for help and I forged on, frustrated
but motivated by the sight of civilization only a few uncrossible feet
away.

Eventually I found some power lines and followed them to a house at
the end of a dirt road. A bit farther down the road I found a person
who told me there was a bridge a little less than a mile
upstream. Once over the bridge I walked down the side of AZ 89A back
to the spot where my trail was supposed to cross the river. I found
the trail easily and was relieved to be back on the Right and
True. Much to my dismay I soon discovered that this trail was supposed
to go *back* across the river for the last leg back to the trail
head. Of course I knew this was folly and so I resigned myself to walk
along the side of the highway all the way into and through town, out
the other side, and up the road that led to where Van Halen sat
waiting. I had planned on a nice, 3 hour hike but by the time I got
back I had been out for over 6 hours. Woof! I was tired, but all in
all it had been a pretty fun adventure.

  <figcaption>Festive festivals</figcaption>

After resting a bit I went to check out a Christmas festival thing at
a local collection of art galleries and shops. It seemed like the whole
town was there and the air was very festive and welcoming. The best
part was that all of the galleries were giving out treats and candies!
And these weren't some cheap-ass candies either. I gave nothing, yet
took everything; a class war fought one Ferro-Rocher at a time. I left
with both my stomach and pockets full of sweets.

Breaking with my established routine I decided to camp on some Forest
Service land a few miles out of town and this proved to be one of the
best decisions I've made so far. Returning to the outdoors was nice
and I somehow felt less lonely than I would have staying downtown
surrounded by people.

After many nights of clouds I was completely surprised at the piercing
clarity of the stars. The last time I had seen skies this dark was in
the middle of Nevada almost 7 years ago; not even the top of Kitt Peak
could compare to that night outside Sedona. I went to bed with aching
legs and a full heart.
