Island in the Sky is the more northern and more popular district of
Canyonlands NP, and, while it does border the [Needles]({{ site.url
}}{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2017-04-17-Needles), the two districts are
separated by the mighty canyons of the Colorado River and therefore
are about 3-4 hours away from each other (hence the separate post). As
you'll see, they also offer quite different experiences (at least to
me).

I wanted to get an early start exploring the park, so the night before
visiting I left Moab and camped on some BLM land just outside the park
entrance (about 40 minutes or so from downtown). It was extremely
windy and I spent the night huddled in Van Halen watching [John
Carpenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGME6jCwqw0) movies.

Early the next morning I was at the ranger station seeking some good
trail info. When asked, the ranger did not hesitate to suggest the
Murphy Loop trail and I admired his conviction so much I decided to go
for it. The trail starts with a nice stroll along the top of the mesa
that makes up the Island in the Sky and the ground was covered with
pasture land dotted with pine and juniper. It really felt like a walk
through some empty corner of Montana or Wyoming.

The suddenly, BAM!, you come to the edge of the mesa and are reminded
that you are about 1,400 quite vertical feet above White Rim Road
(where the trail goes) and even farther above the Green River.

The descent to the base of the Kayenta formation is an impressive feat
of trail construction and was reminiscent of the logic-defying
switchbacks of the [Moki Dugway]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2016-12-16-VotG#the-moki-dugway). I picked my way along
narrow ledges, down talus slopes, and across a wooden bridge, at each
turn guided by the solemn presence of a cairn, until I was safely at
the base of the cliff where the trail split.

Upon the ranger's advice I went out along the Hogsback (is everything
called Hogsback out here?) - a spit of higher White Rim stone that
allows consistent views down to the a deeper past as the trail makes
its way towards White Rim Road. This section of the tail was extremely
easy and pleasant. The way was flat and well packed and, although the
Sun was out, it was very cool and just about perfect walking
conditions. Every once and a while I would hear/see a dirtbike or two
far off on the White Rim Road, but these were only temporary
intrusions to my reverie.

The views were good, but never quite spectacular - I wasn't high
enough to get a commanding view of the whole area - and the pleasure
of the hike came mostly from the walk itself and not necessarily the
environment, which seemed a little strange.

Once at the road I followed it for a about a mile to a the return
trail up a wash. On the road I met a few bikers/off-roaders who were
doing a traverse of the whole White Rim Road (>100 miles!). There are
established backcountry sites for this purpose and it seems like it
would be a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing.

The trail up the wash (Murphy Wash?) was very sandy but offered some
different scenery as I walked back to the base of the cliffs of the
Kayenta. At the bottom of the cliff I decided to push myself and I
attacked the steep track with aggressive vigor. Only a short while
later, panting and cursing with a heart set to bursting, I was on top
and feeling quite accomplished. The final stretch to Van Halen was
easy-peesy and soon I was back home.

After these exertions I drove to Grand View Point for some views and a
PB&J. From up on top of the mesa the jagged and winding canyons of the
Colorado are more visible and cut an impressive landscape in the rock
thousands of feet below. The hoodoos and spires of the inner canyons
look tiny compared to the grand forms around them and towering high
above everything the distant and snow covered La Sal mountains form a
striking backdrop.

After Grand View I was off to the Green River Overlook where similar
view awaited, now punctuated by the water of the Green River and its
lush banks.

The final stop in the park was Upheaval Dome and a viewpoint that let
me look down on what is perhaps an ancient meteor impact. Cool! The
jagged, fractured rocked seemed out of place in a landscape
dominated by smooth erosion and the soft tyranny of time.

On the way back to Moab I realized two things that had been bubbling
beneath the surface all day. First, [Needles]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/posts/2017-04-17-Needles) is better than Island in the
Sky; it offers more (any) opportunities to get up close and personal
with the amazing canyon environment whereas Island in the Sky mostly
contains you to float above it. Second, today was the first day I
began to feel "saturated" with the beauty of Red Rock country. Don't
get me wrong, I still love it, but I increasingly felt my attentions
directed inward, even while surrounded by great beauty. This is not a
bad thing; wilderness begets contemplation and sometimes that's
exactly what you need.
