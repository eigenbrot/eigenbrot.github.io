Hello, my name is Arthur and I'm an Astronomer! I just got my PhD and
was scheduled to spend a year at the South Pole maintaining the Ice
Cube neutrino detector. Unfortunately some jerk in Denver thought I
was not psychologically qualified to handle the work so now I'm
traveling the country in a van doing science and soaking up the
American Spirit.
