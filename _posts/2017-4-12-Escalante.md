After leaving [Bryce Canyon]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-04-10-Bryce) it was back on UT 12 east into the Grand
Staircase/Escalante National Monument (GSENM). The GSENM is the
largest National Monument in America and encompasses a huge amount of
land and a wide variety of environments. For this trip I would focus
on the eastern section: The Canyons of the Escalante. The road here is
very good and passes by and through a never ending sequence of amazing
views.

# Slot Canyons

I stopped at a BLM office to get a (free) permit to camp in the GSENM
and a better map of the area, as well as some information on the most
popular hikes out in the monument. In the town of Escalante
(pronounced "Eskalanee", not "Escalahnte") I got a little more beta
at a local outfitters and learned that some of the slot canyons I had
planned to visit were under about 4 feet of water. Good to know! and I
crossed them off my list. The hour was getting late so I stopped to
camp at a large dispersed camping area right at the top of Hole in the
Rock road, which is the main artery for travel into the heart of the
GSENM. From my camp I could see far across the plains of the monument
and down along the sheer cliffs of the Kaiparowits Plateau. Tomorrow I
would journey out into this wilderness.

It felt wonderful to sleep in the next morning, but soon I was up and
heading down Hole in the Rock (HITR) towards some trailheads and slot
canyons. The road is well graded dirt and certainly better than some I
had been on - I could go 30, 40, and even 50 mph in some places - but
it was still very washboarded and often very brutal. My original plan
to go all the way to 40 mile road and Dance Hall Rock was quickly
abandoned; the thought of driving 80+ miles on a bumpy dirt road was
not appealing and Van Halen deserves better.

13 miles in I reached Devil's Playground and stopped to asses the
condition of Van Halen and to take in the surroundings. Van Halen was
doing great and the Devil's Playground provided an hour's worth of fun
as I explored the twists and turns of paths leading between the jumble
of hoodooos. This would be a great place to bring kids or to be a kid
a heart; it really is like a giant playground.

Another 13 miles farther into the wild I found the Dry Fork road and
associated trailhead. This trail led to my goal for the day: the slot
canyons of Peek-a-boo and Spooky gulches. Looking out across the
slickrock from the parking lot you wouldn't expect the area to be full
of slot canyons, but I guess that's kind of the point. A short trail
led down to the bottom of Dry Fork wash where I found the entrance to
Peek-a-boo gulch. Access to the gulch required climbing a 20 foot
wall of sandstone, and a few groups ahead of me were having some
trouble with this. In a boost to my self-confidence I found it quite
easy to scramble up the wall and I even helped a nice family who were
coming up behind me. The were very friendly and we spent the rest of
the day together.

Once inside, Peek-a-boo was _awesome_. It is windy, crazy, narrow, and
had a few holes full of water that required some creative climbing to
get around. It was extremely fun to navigate the canyon and the
experience was made better by the wonderful companionship of my new
friends.

After emerging from Peek-a-boo we traversed some slickrock to the end
of Spooky gulch for the return journey. Spooky is dry and straighter
than Peek-a-boo, but made up for this by being extremely narrow. Like
backpacks off, squeeze through narrow. As we shimmied down the gulch
sandstone walls shot 50 feet above our heads to blot out all but a
very narrow strip of sky. When passing people coming the other
direction we either had to squeeze into tiny cracks or simply wedge
ourselves up the walls to let them pass underneath. What a trip!

By the time we finished both canyons I had become fast friends with
the two sisters and their sons and they very generously invited me
back to their camp for the night (which was actually in the area I was
planning to camp anyway). I met their father/grandfather who was very
bravely driving a medium-sized RV across these rugged dirt roads. We
crossed HITR road and made camp in the foothills of the Kaiparowits
Plateau. They gave me drinks and even let me eat dinner with
them. This meant a lot to me and I happily spent the rest of the night
around their campfire enjoying the company and the view.

# Batty Pass Caves

The next morning we all decided to take a very short hike up the road
beyond our camp to a series of artificial caves that had been blasted
out of the rock. Local history suggests that these caves were created
in the 50's by some German brothers who were seeking a new life on the
edge of civilization.

{% include gallery id="cave_ex" class="half" caption="The Batty pass caves" %}

The three caves included a living quarters, a very large workshop, and
something that looked like a boat-building area (apparently they were
worried about the waters of Lake Powell reaching them way up
here. Ha!) The first two had surprisingly sturdy doors and well-laid
concrete floors. It all felt so old, but 1956 really wasn't that long
ago!

# Calf Creek

After visiting the caves I said goodbye to the lovely family and headed
back out HITR road. I'm not sure why, but the return journey seemed
much harder than the drive in and by the time I had reached UT 12 my
shelves had shaken themselves bare.

After putting my living room back in order I headed east on UT 12 to
the Calf Creek recreation area (still in the GSENM). There is a small,
nice campground here ($$) but most people come for the hike to Lower
Calf Creek Falls. I was one of these people and was soon setting out
up Calf Creek.

 <figcaption>Calf Creek Trail</figcaption>
</figure>

The trail was a well-maintained 3 miles of walking along sand through
the lively riparian environment along the creek itself. Under the
watchful presence of towering cliffs of Navajo Sandstone tall reeds
and cottonwoods hung along the banks and the occasional beaver dam
formed large ponds that teemed with life. The overall effect was very
peaceful. Far across the creek, on one of the walls of stone, is
perhaps the best set of pictographs I have seen to date. Very cool:

Eventually the trees became thicker and the air wetter as I reached
the falls themselves. Here the water of Calf Creek drops over 100 feet
into a large pool flanked by a sandy beach and a robust stand of
trees. I soaked my feet and washed my face in the frigid water and was
very much renewed after the hot hike. The hike back out was much nicer
with a wet hat on my head!

After the hike I returned to Escalante town for some supplies and to
do some work at a local cafe. I had dinner at the local-recommended
Circle D eatery where I got a hamburger that was notable for the
quality of the meat, but sadly not much else. Once again I camped at
the top of HITR road and fell asleep as memories of the past few days
put a smile on my lips.

# Errata

* The Dry Fork trailhead has two parking lots: one for high clearance
  vehicles and one for the rest of us. In this high clearance lot I
  saw a Rav4 that had a spare tire installed! If I had got a flat
  anywhere on HITR road I would have immediately turned around got the
  hell out of there!

* The family I met at Peek-a-boo and Spooky had a CD player in their
  RV but no CD's. I gave them copies of the
  [two](https://thebegowatts.bandcamp.com/album/the-begowatts-ep)
  [Begowatts](https://thebegowatts.bandcamp.com/album/photoelectric)
  albums I had. I hope they like 'em because that's all they have to
  listen to!

* The skies in the GSENM were very dark, but while I was parked at the
  top of HITR road I was surprised how bright the tiny towns of
  Escalante and Boulder were on the horizon.

* The girl running the Sinclair in Escalante was friendly and in a
  "very good mood". She used to be a model for Budweiser and worked for
  a rapper out in San Diego, but recently moved to the middle of
  southern Utah to raise a kid. Weird.

* The grocery store in Escalante was depressingly stocked. I literally
  took one of the last loaves of bread they had.
