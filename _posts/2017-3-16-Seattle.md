After my mishap in [Napavine]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-03-14-Napavine) I completed the remaining few hours to Seattle
with no problems. Unsurprisingly it was raining a lot when I got there
and one of the first things I did was buy new wiper blades, which
turned out to be money very well spent.

A friend of mine in Seattle lives in a sort of tech co-op called
[Leastsqaures](http://leastsquar.es) and they generously offered me
space on one of their spare beds. The view from the porch, overlooking
Portage Bay out to the UW football stadium, was excellent even in grey
conditions. Their house was well located and for most of my time in
Seattle Van Halen stayed parked in the driveway.

On the morning of the second day I awoke with shock to find the sun
shining, the birds singing, and the people out enjoying a rare day of
wonderful March weather. My friend and I took advantage of the respite
from the rain as he showed me all over the Capitol Hill
neighborhood. After an amazing sandwich at the resurrected Paseo's
we hopped on bikes (it is Seattle, after all) and did a bike tour of
some of the many (many) brewpubs in Fremont and Ballard. On the way
back we stopped at Gas Works park and took in some amazing views of
downtown across Lake Union:

Gas Works Park itself was also pretty darn neat. The rusting husk of
the eponymous works provide some industrial art that combines well
with greens lawns and vistas of the city. Despite the fact that it was
a weekday afternoon the park was full of people enjoying the weather
to its fullest. Maybe you get work off if the weather is nice here.

The next day it was raining again but I managed to make the most of it
by staying inside most of the time :). I did venture out enough to
meet another friend of mine who worked with me on the [Sloan Digital
Sky Survey](http://www.sdss.org/) and now continues the work at
[UW](http://www.washington.edu/) (the other
[UW](http://www.wisc.edu)). I was able to trade a can of Wisconsin
beer for a coveted Sloan Plate. That evening I went out and ended up
at a bar that was supposedly the last place Kurt Cobain was seen
alive. Perhaps even cooler; they had a portrait of [Laura
Palmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXrjMaVoTy0) above the bar.

The next morning I was on the road once more. Seattle is a great city
and those who know don't need me to tell them. Those who don't know
will hopefully find out for themselves sometime. Just make sure you go
to Paseo's. And go in July.
