Hello, my name is Arthur and I'm one of two IceCube Winterovers for
the 2016/17 season, which means I'll be living at the [Amundsen-Scott
South Pole
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott_South_Pole_Station)
from October 2016 to November 2017. The South Pole is the coldest,
windiest, driest, darkest place a person can live and I get the
pleasure of spending 13 months there!
