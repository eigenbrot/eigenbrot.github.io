I slept in late after my adventure in Sedona but still woke to find
ice on the side of Van Halen facing away from the sun. It had dipped
to 24 degrees inside last night.

I took a very lazy breakfast and then a short drive to check out the
airstrip of the [Central Arizona Modelers](http://www.camodelers.com/)
model airplane club. The club was out flying and I showed up just in
time to watch a pretty spectacular crash. Ouch.

I hung around for a while and then got back on AZ 89A south across the
Verde valley. My destination was the mountain town of Jerome, which
had been recommended to me by a trusted confidant back in Madison (who
might even be *reading these very words right now!*). I spent the day
in Jerome just sort of wandering around and generally taking it real
easy. Jerome certainly appreciates this kind of vibe; it's very artsy,
but in a much more friendly and approachable way than Sedona. The town
itself is draped upon a steep hill and has a very vertical layout. I
would be really nice to spend a day or two here when I have more money
at some point in the future.

One of the main attractions is the Gold King gold mine and ghost town,
which is really just a big junk yard, on the edge of town. "Junk"
isn't quite the right word, though; it's a collection of old vehicles
and mining machinery that have been brought there by the owners and it
was relaxing to just wander down rows and rows of old trucks and
cranes.

Apart from the cool buses and whatnot there were a few items that
stood out as actually pretty darn unique. The first was an
industrial-sized drum of the short-lived holiday classic: "Cream of
Spotted Owl soup". Just across the way from that was a goat that
clearly had a lot of diva blood in it; it kept striking poses on a
rock and gave me a look that said "I know I'm fabulous. What do *you*
do?". Finally, there was an *electric* car from way back before they
even had steering wheels. The associated plaque said it got about 50
miles to a charge. Pretty cool!  <br> <br>

Before the Sun got too low I left Jerome and drove the rest of AZ 89A
into Prescott (pronounced "Prescutt" for some reason) where I found
another campsite on Forest land just outside the city. I constructed a
fire while cooking rice but never actually lit it; my heart wasn't
really into it. The thermometer read 43 but it felt much colder than
that. Time to bundle up.

A few other observations:

* Jerome was full of Miatas and I can see why. Higher up in the
  mountains the road was very windy and empty. Perfect driving
  conditions.

* Are sweet onions and yellow onions different? They were different prices at the grocery store.

* KAFF 92.9 American Country is the only radio station I've been able
  to reliably get for the last few days and is thus all I've been
  listening to. At first I didn't mind when they played "Dirt on My
  Boots", "May You" (May We?), and "Blue is Not Your Color" three
  times an hour, but it's starting to get a little ridiculous.
 
 * I spent the next two days in Prescott. All I did was work at the
   library and leave, so there's nothing to say about the city itself.
