It's been a long time since I posted (the reason for which I will
write about soon) and as a celebration of the resumption of my journey
around America I've collected all the little bits of information that
didn't fit into other posts. Here are some stories from the road,
weird sights, weird places, and general tomfoolery between the main
posts.

# Southwest Roadside Attractions

The Southwestern US is probably one of my favorite places on Earth (as
this blog attests to) and a big reason for this adulation are the
strange locations and sights that punctuate the otherwise uninhabited
spaces. A prime example of this is the Target store found on US 90 in
western Texas.

Another interesting stretch of road was NM 9, which kisses the Mexican
border all the way across the state. At its western end there are a
lot of private, remote observatories scattered around the town of
Animas. These are usually owned/rented by enthusiasts or small school
departments and can be control entirely via the internet. I think I
might have even used one of them back in college. Cool.

NM 9 was a strange road for other reasons. The AAA map I was using
listed a few towns spread out more-or-less evenly along its length,
but most of these "towns" turned out to be nothing more than two signs
in the middle of nowhere. Another weird sight was a regular
distribution of pairs of tires left on the side of the road. Each pair
consisted of one very large truck tire and one normal sized tire. I
suspect they were left there on purpose for reasons that are beyond my
understanding.

# Strange Vehicles

Driving America's highways and byways means looking at a lot of cars
and most of them are basically the same; modern, roundish sedans in
colors that probably involve the name of minerals like cobalt and
mica. Seeing cool, unique cars was rare, and taking a picture of one
was even rarer. Below are two of these double rarities: 

One is a huge RV/wilderness assault vehicle I saw in the back country
parking lot at the Grand Canyon. It looked like it was traveling all
around the world and was certainly equipped to do so. One of those
spare tires probably cost more than my entire van. 

The other was a funky little Mini Cooper from back when they were made
by subjects of the Queen. Attitude all around.

# The Hobby Eberly Telescope

Any self-respecting Astronomer who finds themselves in west Texas is
inexorably pulled toward the McDonald Observatory and I proved to be
no exception. The main attraction here is the Hobby Eberly Telescope
(HET), which is somewhat unique in that it is slightly less capable
than other telescopes but hugely less expensive. The HET is also the
model for the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), itself the
scourge of my early grad school career.

I only had time to briefly look around the HET, but I've seen a lot of
telescopes so I knew most of the punch lines already. In the pictures
below you can see the dome of the telescope and then a view of the
main mirror (hard to see with all the reflections). The most exciting
things for me were the big stacks of black boxes on the side of the
mirror that contain the VIRUS spectrograph and pique my fiber-optic
interest.

# Saguaro National Park

Just outside of Tucson, AZ (on both sides, actually) is Saguaro
National Park and for the all the time I spent in this fine* city I
never actually made it out to see the cacti (maybe because you can
see them everywhere anyway). I stopped at the western section of the
park and found a dirt auto-trail that wound through a vibrant
environment with a dizzying amount of desert flora. Again, if you have
spent time around Tucson you probably won't see anything new, but it
was still nice to see this ecosystem in its mostly pristine
state. Here are some pictures:

# Slab City

</figure>

The last time I was in [Slab
City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City,_California) a friend of
mine had to crawl under our bus/RV with a huge screw driver to bypass
a stuck solenoid while a crazy person with an ax was looking for us
and the rest of us huddled inside. I then drove the bus, while
blackout drunk, out of Slab City to a hiding place along a nearby
canal (ALL OF THAT IS TRUE). Needless to say it left quite the
impression.

Seven years later I returned to find Slab City unsettlingly normal. I
spent the night and walked around a bit and the whole place feels a
lot more like an actual town than it did previously (the city and
school buses actually stop here now). So while I went looking for
crazy adventures on the edge of civilization I instead felt like a
trespasser in a community that just wanted to live their lives and not
have people bug them. Here are the obligatory pictures of weird art:

# California Foothills

On my way into northern California I spent a lot of time on CA 49 as
it snaked its way north along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. In
many areas this road was very empty and afforded access to some truly
spectacular views. The switchbacks down to the Merced River, in
particular, compelled me to stop and take a picture:

Farther north, and after crossing many more rivers, the road gets to
the confluence of the North and Middle forks of the American River. A
good place to enjoy the view.
