This was supposed to be a post about a simple drive from Seattle to
Bishop, but it was a long way and a lot of stuff happened so I've
split up the post into the two days (one good and one bad) it took me
to get there and organized it by where I spent the night. Enjoy!

# Bend

After leaving [Seattle]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-03-16-Seattle) I needed to get to Southern California
quickly so I had a few days of long driving that was sometimes hard,
sometimes pleasant, and always interesting. My first destination was
Bend, OR, which I intended to reach via Cascade Locks and some scenic
roads around Mt. Hood. I was not far outside of Seattle on I-5,
however, when Van Halen's check engine light came on again. Bad
memories of [engine failure]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/posts/2017-03-14-Napavine) were still very fresh in my memory so I
immediately found an O'Reilly shop and checked the code. Fortunately
the problem was not serious and did not involve the new crank sensor,
but there was a report of misfires in one or more cylinders. This is
not a disastrous error code and I figured it was probably due to old
spark plug wires so I bought a new set of wires, cleared the code, and
continued on with a shadow of concern in my mind.

In Vancouver, WA the sun started to peek out from behind the clouds as
I turned onto WA 14 towards Cascade Locks and the Bridge of the
Gods. I chose to cross the Columbia here because my
[brother](http://threeveweaver.wordpress.com) had been through on the
PCT a few years ago and [spoke
highly](https://threeveweaver.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/day-111/) of
this little town nestled along the river. Sadly, by the time I got
there the weather was kind of lame and I decided to just push on. Once
in Washington I hit I-84 east until cutting south on OR 35 around
Mt. Hood. Up on the slopes there was still a lot of snow and most of
the car parks were full of people enjoying a decent day on the
mountain. Unfortunately low clouds kept Mt. Hood itself totally
obscured from view.

Soon after turning south on US 26 I got another check engine light and
assumed it meant another misfire (which I confirmed at a nearby auto
parts store). At this point I was starting to get pretty nervous with
the frequency of these misfires (over the course of the day I had 3)
and for once I did not really enjoy the solitude I found out on US 97
in Eastern Oregon. In my mind solitude meant less help if something
really bad happened and by the time I rolled into Bend my nerves were
a bit frazzled. In an attempt to feel like I was fixing something I
replaced the only wire that looked like it had any corrosion at all. I
doubted it would make a difference, but it gave me a little power over
the situation.

I only spent a night in Bend, but I really enjoyed my time there. It's
a very lively and hip city given its location sort of out in the
middle of nowhere and is practically overflowing with breweries,
distilleries, and hip, outdoorsy folks. I washed the stress of the day
away with some very good brews from the Deschutes Brewery and met some
locals who took me to a few more neat spots. I stayed up later than I
had planned but slept well and with significantly less anxiety.

# Bishop

My destination for the next day was Bishop, CA, about 600 miles and 12
hours away. Determined to reach Bishop before nightfall I was up well
before the sun and had soon turned off US 97 onto OR 31. Some signs on
the road informed me that OR 31 traversed the "Oregon Outback". This
sent a shiver of misfire-related anxiety down my spine but I was
determined to not worry as much so I pushed that shiver deep down and
hoped I could last the next 12 hours without giving myself an
ulcer. When the sun came up it revealed a a high desert landscape
covered in fog and clouds and empty except for the howling wind and
low trees.

Just north of Summer Lake I hit a milestone: Van Halen rolled over to
150,000 miles! Desolate beauty is sort of my thing so I couldn't
imagine a better place for this to happen than on the side of some
back road with a view of a lake surrounded by snow-capped
mountains. The air was thick with the scent of pine trees and stopping
to take in the view helped me calm down and reminded me why I do this
in the first place.

A few miles down the road, in Valley Falls, OR I hit another, albeit
less impressive, milestone: I turned onto US 395. This strip of
asphalt is perhaps one of the finest roads in America (although the
travels documented on this website have revealed many contenders) and
it holds special significance in my life as the main artery through
which the majesty of the eastern Sierra Nevada was pumped into my
heart. Since my childhood US 395 has lead to hiking, camping,
climbing, and countless memories of time well spent among some of the
finest mountains in the world. Valley Falls, OR was admittedly far from
the memories of my youth, but reaching US 395 felt a bit like a
homecoming; I was on my way to where much of this all started.

Not long afterward I crossed the border into
[Jefferson](http://www.soj51.net) and just south of Alturas I picked
up my first long-distance hitch hiker. He was sitting so far off the
road I almost didn't see him and had to double back to pick him up.
His name was Harley ("like the motorcycle") and, at 68, had decided he
was tired of riding his bicycle laden with camping gear and was
looking for a ride to Reno. After some struggling we got his bike in
Van Halen and resumed our southward journey. I could probably (but
won't) write a whole post about the stories Harley told me as we
traversed the Modoc Plateau south into the Eastern Sierra
foothills. He knew every turn of the highway and had stories about
every abandon way station or dilapidated farm house and made a fine
traveling companion. When I left him a few hours later at a McDonald's
in downtown Reno I was glad for the company he had provided.

More southbound driving out of Reno soon landed me back in California
and I could feel Bishop and the High Sierra pulling me closer. Just
past CA 108, at the Devil's Gate Summit, I turned a corner to suddenly
see the northern end of the High Sierra laid out before me in all of
their brilliant, snow-bound beauty. With the sun shining brightly I
could see far down the spine of the range and as I continued south the
jagged peaks that loomed so large in my mind began to loom large
through my windshield as well.

With such a view it seemed too soon that Mt. Tom and Bishop pass came
into view and my journey came to an end. Some places you can remember
like you never left and Bishop is like that. I parked in front of the
climber hostel in Bishop, paid for a shower, ate a huge burrito (I
hadn't eaten since I left that morning and was _starving_), and spent
a completely relaxing and wonderful evening in a town full of people
who live in one of the best places on Earth. It had taken about 12
hours, but I had made it to Bishop on a day when everything went
exactly right. It was a good day.


Oh yeah, what about those check engine lights from before? Well, I
didn't get a single one since leaving Bend so my current theory is
that the slightly rusty wire I replaced was in fact the
culprit. Electrons are super weird.
