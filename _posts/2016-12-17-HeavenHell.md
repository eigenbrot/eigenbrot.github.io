Breaking tradition, this post isn't really about a place, *per se*,
but rather the space between places. In other words, the Road, and in
particular a drive crazy enough to stick in my memory for a long time.

After leaving Sand Island I made a quick stop in Bluff to reload my
water jug (my Wisconsin stash had finally been depleted!), and this
trip revealed more of Bluff than I had previously seen. Contrary to my
initial conclusion Bluff seems like a pretty neat little town.

In any case, I was soon back on US 163 heading towards Monument
Valley. The weather was stern, but so far not actually that bad. In
fact, the rapidly shifting clouds made the famous monuments quite
striking in a way that was not possible with direct sun alone. I
didn't actually "go" to Monument Valley, but from the road I think I
got enough views to have a sense of the place. What's more, I was
still on a high from the [Valley of the Gods]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/posts/2016-12-16-VotG) and didn't feeling like
visiting a touristy area. Soon after Monument Valley I entered
Arizona, and as I left Utah behind I couldn't help but think that I
was leaving some sort heaven.

After crossing into Arizona US 163 meets US 160 in Kayenta. I stopped
for gas and it was here that I really noticed the *WIND*. It was so
strong I could barely keep my door closed once I opened it. This
torrent of air would stay with me all day.

US 160 makes its course straight across the top of Navajo country and
there really isn't much out there. At one point I hit the "scan"
button and watched in amazement as the radio went through the entire
frequency range with no success. Eventually I reached Tuba City and
soon after that joined US 89 south towards Flagstaff. Just outside
Tuba City the scenery became very bizarre and otherworldly in its
strange starkness. In keeping with the themes running though my head
(and this post), this portion of road was like a sort of purgatory;
not ugly, but too weird to be comforting in its beauty. Once I turned
on the US 89 I left purgatory and turned into the suburbs of Hell
itself. The fierce wind had now picked up dust and sand that blew
across the road in great clouds and limited my vision to no more than
50 feet in front of me. When the sky briefly cleared I could see yet
another strange and totally barren landscape filled with small hills
and craters. Above all of this the blowing dust had turned the low,
roiling clouds a menacing purple color. The overall effect was extreme
and I can honestly say I have never cursed so much in my life.

As the road climbed into the mountains the dust turned to rain and it
was in this condition that I arrived in Flagstaff, AZ. I didn't stay
long, however, and was soon on AZ 89A south towards Sedona. This
portion of the drive was notable for its always just hidden beauty
and I resolved to do it again under better conditions. I was worried
about finding a place to sleep in Sedona because no one parks on the
streets, but I kind grocery store manager said I could park overnight
in his lot and I was soon at a nearby brewery washing down the day's
drive.

I met a very nice guy here who is from Minneapolis and is basically
doing exactly what I'm doing. We had even been in the same places
recently. He claimed that he never had nightmares but sometimes woke
up laughing and advised me to look for what I cannot see and listen
for what I cannot hear. Advice well taken.
